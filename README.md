## Team - AgriFarm 🍅

### Hi there, we are the team behind Agrifarm - Tuhina Tripathi, Anouska Jhunjhunwala, and Ujan Pradhan. We are passionate about technology and agriculture, and have combined our skills to create a web application that optimizes the agricultural supply chain like never before. Our platform, built with Tailwind CSS, React JS, Vite, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, is powered by machine learning algorithms that predict the demand for various agricultural products and provide valuable insights to farmers to plan their production accordingly. We are proud to be transforming the industry by connecting farmers, middlemen, cold storage facilities, and customers, and making agriculture more efficient and sustainable. 

## Problem Statement❔:

### The agricultural supply chain faces numerous challenges, such as the lack of effective communication and coordination between farmers, middlemen, cold storage facilities, and customers. This often leads to inefficiencies in the supply chain, including oversupply or undersupply of products, loss of quality and value, and increased transportation costs.

## Our Solution ✔️: 

### Optimize the agricultural supply chain by connecting farmers, middlemen, cold storage facilities, and customers through our web application as well as applying machine learning algorithm to predict accurate pricing which can be updated on the real time basis.
